 

hackable does not ship with a bootloader, but it is supported in Arduino. Please visit [here](https://github.com/electronut/ElectronutLabs-bluey#Arduino) for details (but select Hackable in the board's menu).

[Here's](https://electronut.in/using-hackable-with-arduino/) a blog article which will help you create a BLE custom characteristic and program it to hackaBLE using Arduino IDE.

The detailed hackaBLE programming guide comming soon.
