# hackaBLE

![hackaBLE](hackaBLE1.jpg)

**hackaBLE** is a tiny (~ 18 mmx 28 mm) Nordic nRF52832 based BLE development board you can embed in your BLE projects. It's designed in such that you can use it three ways:

- On a breadboard
- On a custom PCB, hand-soldered easily using the castellated 2.54 mm pitch headers
- On a custom PCB, using a stencil and oven, making use of extra pads underneath the PCB

hackaBLE uses offers more value than just using the BLE module directly - since it incorporates the necessary passive compoments - including the ones for the buck converter for power saving - and adds an RGB LED and a button for convenience. It's also much easier to solder than the bare modules.
